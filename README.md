# GrandConnect

GrandConnect was created to connect elementary school children and senior citizens in nursing homes to create a community of empowerment and communication. 
* Teachers at elementary schools and activity coordinators at nursing homes will be able to sign up for an account, and then be matched to each other by a coordinator who receives the forms. This means that an elementary school class will have an assigned nursing home, and thus have “Class Grandparents”.
* After they have signed up and been approved, they will be able to sign in and the teacher/children will get access to a calendar to add their availability for video calls. The nursing home/seniors will have access to the calendar to see availability and schedule video calls based on that.

As a teacher, I want the opportunity for my students to adopt a "class grandparent", so that they have new learning opportunities from another generation. 
 ```
